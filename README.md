# SpringBoot-ShoppingCart-CRUD

In this lab, you’ll learn to create, update, and delete items from a shopping list using JavaScript's Fetch API to communicate with a Spring Boot backend. Building on previous lessons about displaying and retrieving data, this lab takes things further by enabling you to manipulate data on the server dynamically. Mastering these skills is essential for any junior software developer and will give you a solid foundation in managing data within web applications.

The problem? A shopping list app that only displays items isn’t enough—users want control over what’s on their list. In this lab, your task is to add functionality that lets users add new products, update existing items, and remove items they no longer need. This will make the app truly interactive and responsive, putting you in the driver’s seat to bring it all to life.

Goal

Learn to use the Fetch API to manage data on a Spring Boot backend. You’ll create a shopping list app where you can add, edit, and remove items using POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.
